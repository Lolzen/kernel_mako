+	  This option will modify all the calls to function tracing
+	  dynamically (will patch them out of the binary image and
+	  replace them with a No-Op instruction) on boot up. During
+	  compile time, a table is made of all the locations that ftrace
+	  can function trace, and this table is linked into the kernel
+	  image. When this is enabled, functions can be individually
+	  enabled, and the functions not enabled will not affect
+	  performance of the system.
+
+	  See the files in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing:
+	    available_filter_functions
+	    set_ftrace_filter
+	    set_ftrace_notrace
 
 	  This way a CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER kernel is slightly larger, but
 	  otherwise has native performance as long as no tracing is active.
 
-	  The changes to the code are done by a kernel thread that
-	  wakes up once a second and checks to see if any ftrace calls
-	  were made. If so, it runs stop_machine (stops all CPUS)
-	  and modifies the code to jump over the call to ftrace.
