 5.3 swappiness
 
 Similar to /proc/sys/vm/swappiness, but affecting a hierarchy of groups only.
+Please note that unlike the global swappiness, memcg knob set to 0
+really prevents from any swapping even if there is a swap storage
+available. This might lead to memcg OOM killer if there are no file
+pages to reclaim.
 
 Following cgroups' swappiness can't be changed.
 - root cgroup (uses /proc/sys/vm/swappiness).
